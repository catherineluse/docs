The integrations presented in this section are with third-party projects and technologies. Some of this documentation comes from community members or maintainers of the projects. As such, these are not covered as part of Rancher's [Support and Maintenance Terms of Service.](https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/)

We welcome more contributions like these. If you would like to document such an integration, please submit a pull request to the [Rancher docs repository](https://github.com/rancher/docs/) in the `content/k3s/latest/en/third-party-integrations` directory.
