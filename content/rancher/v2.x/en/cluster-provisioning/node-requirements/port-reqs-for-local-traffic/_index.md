title: Port Requirements for Local Traffic
weight: 8
---

Ports marked as `local traffic` (i.e., `9099 TCP`) in the port requirements are used for Kubernetes healthchecks (`livenessProbe` and`readinessProbe`).
These healthchecks are executed on the node itself. In most cloud environments, this local traffic is allowed by default.

However, this traffic may be blocked when:

- You have applied strict host firewall policies on the node.
- You are using nodes that have multiple interfaces (multihomed).

In these cases, you have to explicitly allow this traffic in your host firewall, or in case of public/private cloud hosted machines (i.e. AWS or OpenStack), in your security group configuration. Keep in mind that when using a security group as source or destination in your security group, explicitly opening ports only applies to the private interface of the nodes/instances.
